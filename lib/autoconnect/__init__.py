I wrote this module a while ago (5+ years) and though it would be handy
for others. Its a handy auto-socket connection module. I used it
orginally in a internet cafe management system. The client installed
by the installer would start the receiver. It would then wait for the
server to broadcast its URL and on receiving it connect and do its
business.

Check out the example test_server.py and test_client.py for usage examples.

Running the test_server:
    oisin@snorky [autoconnect]> PYTHONPATH=lib/ python lib/autoconnect/example/test_server.py
    Waiting for client to connect.
    Got a new client connection:  <socket._socketobject object at 0x57efc0> ('172.17.125.117', 54323)
    oisin@snorky [autoconnect]>

Running the test_client:
    oisin@snorky [autoconnect]> PYTHONPATH=lib/ python lib/autoconnect/example/test_client.py
    Waiting to receive a broadcast on port: 30000
    Received packet from ('172.17.125.126', 1477)
    Socket connected to server successfully:  ('172.17.125.126', 10000)
    Done, exiting now.
